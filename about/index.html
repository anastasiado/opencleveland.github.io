    <h1>About Open Cleveland</h1>
    <p>Open Cleveland is a group of people, first and foremost. We also call ourselves technologists, planners, designers, doers, thinkers, and activists. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/open-cleveland/">We meet on Wednesdays</a> to actively work together to improve the City of Cleveland and all of Northeast Ohio, often <a href="https://github.com/opencleveland">using technology</a> to support our efforts. By connecting people, organizations, resources, tools, and networks to build for Cleveland, we will all thrive.</p>

    <h2>Brigade</h2>
    <p>Open Cleveland is a local chapter of the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/">Code for America Brigade</a>, an international network of people committed to using their voices and hands, in collaboration with local governments, to make their cities better.</p>

    <!-- PTK commenting out until this is finalized <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>FIX THIS PARAGRAPH Code for San Francisco is a safe space for experimentation, learning and practicing skills, taking chances, and asking questions, all to affect and encourage positive change. Whenever possible, we proactively reach out to those who are left out, excluded, ignored, or discriminated against. Those people, in our opinion, represent our most desirable source for experiences, knowledge, and thoughts. We fail without their involvement. Read Code for San Francisco’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1WcCAWQTfCUhZLqb-AArYDWVWW1E3V96UKDeoIr_3j5s/">2014 strategic plan</a>.</p>-->
